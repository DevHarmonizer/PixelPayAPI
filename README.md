## Why should i use PixelPayAPI?

The idea started when I needed a good MoneyAPI for some of my plugins. Despite hours of searching, I couldn't find one that was perfect for me. So I just thought I'd make my own!

PixelPayAPI is a stable and feature-rich API that brings many possibilities to give your economy system a breath of fresh air!
